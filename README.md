Here's a brief description of each file and directory:

main.go: This is the entry point of the application. It sets up the Gin engine and initializes the routes.

handlers/: This directory contains the HTTP request handlers for each endpoint of the application. In this example, we have a user.go file that handles requests related to users.

models/: This directory contains the data models for the application. In this example, we have a user.go file that defines the User struct.

routes/: This directory contains the routes for the application. In this example, we have a user.go file that sets up the routes for the user-related endpoints.

config/: This directory contains any configuration files for the application. In this example, we have a config.go file that sets up the application configuration.
